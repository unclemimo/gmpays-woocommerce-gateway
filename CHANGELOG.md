## Migration Guide from v1.1.0 to v1.2.0

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: This is a breaking change update

Due to the switch from HMAC to RSA signatures, you must follow these steps:

1. **Backup your current configuration**
2. **Generate new RSA keys** using the included script:
   ```bash
   cd wp-content/plugins/gmpays-woocommerce-gateway/
   chmod +x setup-gmpays.sh
   ./setup-gmpays.sh
   ```
3. **Upload your public key to GMPays**:
   - Go to [cp.gmpays.com/project/sign](https://cp.gmpays.com/project/sign)
   - Paste your public key in the "Public key" field
   - Click "Generate signature HMAC" to regenerate the HMAC key
4. **Update plugin settings**:
   - Replace HMAC Key with RSA Private Key
   - Copy the entire content of `private_key.pem` (including BEGIN/END lines)
5. **Test the integration** with a small transaction

### üîí Security Notes
- Keep your private key secure and never share it
- The private key is stored encrypted in WordPress options
- Public key is uploaded to GMPays for signature verification
- All communications now use RSA-SHA256 signatures
