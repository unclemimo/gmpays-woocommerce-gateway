# GMPays WooCommerce Gateway - Refactoring Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive refactoring performed on the GMPays WooCommerce payment gateway plugin to address critical issues and improve maintainability.

## Critical Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Order Status Not Updating
**Problem**: The plugin relied on unreliable webhooks and URL parameters that GMPays doesn't send consistently.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented proper payment status checking via GMPays API
- Added fallback mechanisms using WooCommerce's built-in thank you page hook
- Removed dependency on unreliable webhook notifications

### 2. Incorrect API Implementation
**Problem**: The current implementation didn't follow GMPays' official API structure.

**Solution**:
- Refactored API client to use correct GMPays API endpoints
- Implemented proper authentication methods (HMAC/RSA)
- Added proper error handling and logging

### 3. Redundant Code
**Problem**: Multiple fallback mechanisms that didn't work properly.

**Solution**:
- Cleaned up duplicate constants and functions
- Streamlined payment processing flow
- Removed unnecessary complexity

### 4. Missing Proper Status Checking
**Problem**: No reliable way to check payment status via API.

**Solution**:
- Added API-based payment status checking
- Implemented automatic order status updates
- Added admin interface for manual status checking
